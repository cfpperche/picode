# Terminals

## Next

- Tab strip: keyboard close of `.mtab-close`; live needs-you arrow; `scrollbar-width: thin` vs webkit.

## Debts

- Terminal menus (2026-09-09): the phone's rows are hand-built, not from `termRowMenu.js` (they gained **Send to terminal…** / **Run command…** on 2026-09-13), so desktop rows must be mirrored by hand; **Continue in…** waits on that merge.
- Scrollbars: the web terminal draws none (a tmux client has no scrollback — `term-scrollbar.test.mjs`); a draggable bar means taking the tmux client off the alternate screen, a decision.
- CLI pane-death (ADR-0085): an owned OpenCode QA stop left two processes after its pane closed; ADR-0084 pins nothing for terminals stopped before it.
- TestPaneRootSurvivesSIGHUP and the peer-stop test went red under concurrent closes (2026-09-13): fixed in `feat/peer-stop-child-race` — the SIGHUP fixtures now use process-unique session names, the peer-stop test waits for the pane's trap and targets tmux without the ambient client. If a tmux fixture reddens again, first suspect a fixed name shared across test binaries.
- tmux: never kill by prefix (a prefix sweep killed 29 sessions in 2026-09-06) — exact names from a fixture's API only; a scratch whose daemon dies before `qa-scratch stop` strands its shells.
