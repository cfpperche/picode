## Debts

- The handoff board was already over its byte cap on `main` (12321 bytes without this branch's note; caps 120 lines / 12288) — it is what made `make close` fail on `feat/html-preview`; prune the topics named by `make handoff`, then re-render.
- `.pi/compact.json` `atPercent 0.5` never fires for large-window models (peaks 379 K); capture tolerance is 128 px.
- `.git` is ~530 MB (UI bundles, MP4s); a history rewrite is the owner's call. Branch protection and CODEOWNERS need the owner.
- Tutorial video freshness audits are stale after source relocation.
- On merging `feat/herdr-validation`/`feat/picode-video-pilot` (pre-ADR-0105): their prose goes to changelog fragments + the session note, not the board.

## Notes

- Hook edits cannot be exercised from a worktree (it runs the root's hooks); a refused commit needs `git -c core.hooksPath=$PWD/.githooks commit`.
- `make ci` failed once (2026-09-12) after Go packages ok, passed on the identical tree — cause unknown; `var/ci-last.log` keeps it diagnosable (retries hide it).
- A branch that edited `docs/handoff.md` pre-ADR-0123 hits one `modify/delete` conflict: resolve with `git rm -f docs/handoff.md` (the hook refuses it staged, on purpose).
