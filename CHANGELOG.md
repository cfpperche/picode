# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Agent contract:** every commit with a user-visible change MUST add an entry
to the `[Unreleased]` section. The repository's official language is English
(see `AGENTS.md`); changelog entries included.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Cursor benchmark**: product patterns (agent activity feed, checkpoints,
  diff review, per-agent model picker, background-agent cards, @-mentions,
  rules management, command palette) mapped to milestones, plus an
  aesthetic/density bar with design tokens — enforced via the `uiux-review`
  skill (`docs/benchmark-cursor.md`).

### Changed

- **Official language set to English**: changelog, docs references and skills
  translated; language policy added to `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Project bootstrap**: public repository, MIT license, CI (GitHub Actions
  with gofmt/vet/test/build across linux/macos/windows), Makefile.
- **Living documentation system**: `docs/` with architecture, philosophy,
  engineering + UI/UX benchmarks, handoff (`docs/handoff.md`) and ADRs
  (`docs/decisions/`) — with an explicit contract that documentation evolves
  with the code (see `AGENTS.md`).
- **Pi agent harness**: root `AGENTS.md` (operating contract), quality skills
  in `.pi/skills/` (`quality-gate`, `uiux-review`, `handoff-update`) and
  project settings in `.pi/`.
- **Go server skeleton**: `picode` binary with UI embedded via `go:embed`,
  `/api/health` and `/api/version` endpoints, dark-first placeholder page
  with a live health check.
- **Initial decision records (ADRs)**: browser app served by a single Go
  binary (0001), dual-channel tmux+RPC agent control (0002), dependence on
  user-installed `pi` (0003).
