# Providers

PiCode reads and writes the same `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` as the pi TUI. Keys are never shown again after save.

Canonical: [pi Providers](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/providers.md).

## Sign in

**Add provider** (or `/login`) → pick a provider.

| Method | In PiCode |
|---|---|
| API key | All providers that accept a key |
| Account | Claude, Codex, Copilot, Kimi, xAI |
| Either | Claude, Kimi, xAI, OpenRouter, … |

Account login opens a browser tab (Claude, Codex) or shows a device code (Copilot, Kimi, xAI). Radius account login stays in the TUI (needs a gateway URL).

**Replace** runs the same wizard. **Sign out** removes that entry from `auth.json`.
